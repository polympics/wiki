<h1>Events</h1>
<p>The Polympics will host ten event contests, each having a set of commissioners (directors).  All of the commissioners together are Polympic Committee.</p>
<p>Players register through the Polympics website, become a member of the Polympics discord server, and join a team based on nationality. Teams will send players to compete in events. Some events allow multiple entries per team, others are limited to one representative (or pair of representatives) per team. See event rules for more details. Some events are mobile only while others allow for Steam or mobile users.</p>
